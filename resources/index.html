                Computer Science is an incredibly broad field, and it is often tough for beginners who are interested in the subject to get their feet wet in the subject because of its complex nature, learning curve, and copious career sub-paths. This section seeks to provide beginners more accessible resources to get them interested, engaged, and off the ground with CS!

            <h1 id="fundementals">Programming Fundamentals</h1>
            <p>
                An all too common question in the realm of beginner computer scientists is what programming language to learn first. Despite fierce debates over the answer, and language loyalists muddying the waters for the uninitiated, this is far from as serious a decision as many make it out to be. As long as you begin with a reasonably popular and well-structured language, you will be absolutely fine. With that said, however, we do recommend that beginners start with Java due to its highly structured nature, which guides beginners to a better understanding of both the mechanics of a programming language and the bigger-picture concepts in CS.

            <h1 id="command-line">The Command-Line</h1>
            <p>
                Every computer scientist should be familiar with the command-line interface present on their computer.
                <br><br>
                A command-line interface, or CLI, allows you to interact with your computer's operating system through a text-based interface, abstracting away some complexities of the operating system itself. Due to this encapsulation, the most used term to describe such programs is a "shell". Understanding the shell you use will empower you to save time bypassing clunky graphical interfaces, perform full-featured scripting, and much more!
                <br><br>
                Below are beginners' guides for Windows, MacOS, and Linux shells. Although Linux/BSD shells vary based on flavor/distribution, and MacOS ships with zsh as its default shell, the guide by Ubuntu will almost always apply regardless.
